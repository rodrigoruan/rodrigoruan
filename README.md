## Hello, my name is Rodrigo Ruan! :nerd_face:

I'm a software engineer, currently studying Node and Flutter.

In 2021 I started to study at Trybe to learn web development and I loved
it, in the same year I started at Universade Anhembi Morumbi too, where
I'm graduating at Science Computer.

I love writing codes and my skills are
<br/>
JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, CSS3, HTML5, Git, MongoDB, Node, Bootstrap, MySQL, Python and C++.

My hobbies are watching animes (berserk is the best!) and studying competitive programming.
